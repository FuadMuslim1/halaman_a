# Cleanup Plan for Gabungan Folder

## Steps to Complete:
- [ ] Standardize Language: Translate all comments and UI text to English across all files.
- [ ] Format Code: Apply consistent 2-space indentation, proper line breaks, and readable structure to all JavaScript and CSS files.
- [ ] Refactor Structure: Convert IIFEs to class-based Web Components where possible; separate concerns (CSS, HTML, JS) in focus_mode_button.js, example.js, and tips.js.
- [ ] Fix Inconsistencies: Update Font Awesome to latest version, correct custom element names (e.g., <my-go-back> to match 'go-back-button'), remove duplicates in index.html.
- [ ] Update index.html: Fix duplicate <title>, remove references to missing scripts like button_logout.js, ensure all custom elements are properly defined.
- [ ] Clean ʌ.css: Translate Indonesian comments to English, remove redundancies.
- [ ] Refactor components/sidebar.js: Format code, translate comments, ensure proper class structure.
- [ ] Refactor components/focus_mode_button.js: Convert to Web Component, add auto-scrolling logic for word cards during video playback.
- [ ] Update components/button_go_back.js: Update Font Awesome version, fix custom element naming.
- [ ] Refactor components/example.js: Convert to Web Component for word cards.
- [ ] Refactor components/tips.js: Translate UI text to English, convert to Web Component.
- [ ] Implement TODO: Add auto-scrolling for word cards during video playback in focus mode.
- [ ] Organize Files: Ensure logical grouping, remove any unused code.
- [ ] Test Functionality: Run the application and verify all features work correctly after changes.
